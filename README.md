# Constraints-and-EDFs

This directory contains all of the code used in my Senior Honours Project "Application of Constraint Solving to External Difference Families and Related Structures". [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) is used to generate valid parameter sets for EDFs, [Essence/Conjure](https://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to model these parameter sets as constraint problems and search for solutions; and Python is used to verify solutions and print information about them.

## Python EDFs

Install using
```
pip3 install -e python/pythonedfs
```
